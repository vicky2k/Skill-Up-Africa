### Explanation of First Class and Second Class Citizens


In programming language design, a first-class citizen (also type, object, entity, or value) in a given programming language is an entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified, and assigned to a variable

In computer programming, a first-class object, first-class citizen, or first-class value is a language entity (e.g., function or variable) that operates as other entities in a language.

For example, in the C programming language, you cannot pass a function to another function as a parameter. So in C, functions are referred to as "second-class objects." However, in JavaScript a function can be passed to another function as a parameter, therefore in JavaScript, functions are first-class.

This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.
