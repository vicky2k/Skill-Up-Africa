# The Explanation of Polymorphism to a Five Year Old.

Polymorphism is one of the four basic concepts in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages. It describes the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
For Instance, Superman gives me an Orange Fruit which has the power to change into a Mango fruit, a Paw Paw Fruit or an Apple. This Orange Fruit which Superman gives me can be said to be Polymorphic.
