###### Javascript DOM Explanation

DOM stands Document Object Model and this is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dybamically access and update the content, structure and style of a document. Javascript DOM also refers to the model of the document that forms the current web page. 
With the DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document. The Javascript  DOM structure forms a Tree Like Outline that shows the hierachy of elements in a web page.

HTML elements normally exist as objects which in turn have properties, methods and events and in JavaScript, elements in the DOM are targeted with query selector methods.

Some DOM Targetting Methods within a Document include

Document.body, Document.title, Document.url

There are other older methods such as 
getElementsByID
getElementsByClassName
getElementsByTagName

etc.
